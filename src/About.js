                <p> I am an undergraduate at Indian Institute of Information Technology. In my short experience with
                    software industry, I've
                    developed Analytical thinking and collaboration skills. Being a quick and logical learner, I am
                    able to grasp anything from scratch.

                    I have led different clubs and teams successfully, also have been fortunate enough to guide
                    bright minds of IIIT Allahadbad in Data structures and algorithms. I am
                    interested in pushing the boundaries of technology with innovation in the fields of Software
                    Development, Cloud Computing and Machine Learning.
